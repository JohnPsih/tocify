## scoring block
Scoring calibration:
Score ≥ 0.80 ONLY if the item clearly involves electrophysiology or physiological time series
  (EEG/MEG/LFP/iEEG/ECoG/neuronal spiking) OR aperiodic/1/f, oscillations, waveform shape,
  spectral parameterization, or neuronal timescales — OR introduces a general time-series/signal
  processing method that would transfer to those data.

If it is primarily about drugs/behavior/psychiatric symptoms without neural/physio time-series analysis,
  cap score at 0.40.

If it is primarily microbiology/immunology/metabolism/genetics without neural dynamics methods,
  cap score at 0.25. -->

## narrative
My research focuses on the intersection of mathematical modeling and the physical properties of biological systems, specifically focusing on the complex behavior of biofilms in viscoelastic fluids. A key component of this work involves characterizing the viscoelastic behavior of biofilm through both modeling and experimental studies to understand how these bacterial communities deform and resist external forces.

This investigation extends to the fluid environment, where you analyze the structure and dynamics of turbulence in viscoelastic channel flow, examining how the unique properties of these fluids influence flow patterns. Finally, your work bridges the gap between physics and biology by studying the mechanical interactions between biofilm infections and phagocytic immune cells, providing insight into how the viscoelastic nature of biofilms contributes to their resilience against the body's natural defenses.
