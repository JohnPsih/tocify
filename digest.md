arXiv:2602.11122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross Abstract: The K-condition introduced by Shizuta and Kawashima provides a sufficient criterion for the global existence of smooth solutions to dissipative hyperbolic systems. For genuinely nonlinear characteristic fields, a weaker K-condition becomes necessary, although not sufficient. In this paper, we analyze this weaker K-condition through the study of acceleration waves propagating in an equilibrium state. We investigate two classes of hyperboli…

Author(s): Jianxun Huang and Ri Li<br /><p>Bubble dynamics is critical for mass, momentum, and heat transport in two-phase flows. We investigated the effects of surface wettability on bubble formation, departure, and the surrounding liquid flow. Two-phase particle image velocimetry (PIV) captured the transient liquid-phase velocity field and instantaneous bubble shape. The experiments revealed strong wettability dependence in bubble size, departure frequency, and thus liquid phase flow dynamics.…

Author(s): Andrea Montessori, Marco Lauricella, Aritra Mukherjee, and Luca Brandt<br /><p>How a dispersed bubble phase reshapes turbulence remains a long-standing question, especially at moderate void fractions where coupling spans many scales. Using high-resolution lattice-Boltzmann simulations of forced homogeneous isotropic turbulence, we find that the global energy cascade stays close to Kolmogorov behavior up to 24% gas volume fraction. Phase-conditioned spectra, however, show a distinct ga…

Author(s): Jake Buzhardt and Michael D. Graham<br /><p>Controlling fluid flows to induce laminarization is a challenging task due to the chaotic nature of turbulent flows. We introduce the “minimal seed for relaminarization”: the smallest perturbation of a turbulent state that triggers laminarization without a chaotic transient. This minimal seed and its trajectory provide an efficient laminarization pathway out of the turbulent region of the state space. Using a nonlinear optimization framework…

arXiv:2602.12832v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: About forty years ago, it has been predicted that a charged particle, moving parallel to a charged wall in an electrolyte, should experience a lift force that, contrarily to electrostatic forces, is not screened at large distances. Up to now, such electroviscous lift force has not been directly measured. Here, we use Atomic Force Microscopy to directly measure the electroviscous lift force and quantify its dependency with the distance to the wall…

We address this question by optimizing incompressible two-dimensional fluid flows in a straight channel to maximize heat transfer under a fixed input power budget. Using an adjoint-based gradient framework combined with the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) optimization algorithm, we find that optimal flows remain predominantly unidirectional up to a critical Péclet number. …
