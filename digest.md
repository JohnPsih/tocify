arXiv:2602.08645v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: A fully coupled implicit finite-volume algorithm for incompressible viscoelastic interfacial flows is proposed, whereby the viscoelasticity of the flow is described by an upper-convected Maxwell constitutive model, including limited extensibility and shear-thinning behaviour. The governing equations describing the conservation of continuity and momentum, as well as the constitutive model are discretized using standard finite-volume methods and are …

arXiv:2602.08737v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Understanding how cells escape from embedded spheroids requires a mechanical framework linking stress generation within cells, across cells, and between cells and the surrounding extracellular matrix (ECM). We develop such a framework by coupling a 3D vertex model of a spheroid to a fibrous ECM network and deriving a 3D Cauchy stress tensor for deformable polyhedral cells, enabling direct cell-level stress quantification in three dimensions. We a…

arXiv:2602.08270v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Turbulence is a complex, irregular flow phenomenon ubiquitous in natural processes and engineering applications. The Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) method, owing to its low computational cost, has become the primary approach for rapid simulation of engineering turbulence problems. However, the inaccuracy of classical turbulence models constitutes the main drawback of the RANS framework. With the rapid development of data-driven approaches, …

arXiv:2407.19466v3 Announce Type: replace Abstract: We theoretically and numerically investigate the steady flow of two-dimensional granular materials in a rotating drum using the discrete element method and a continuum model with the $\mu(I)$-rheology. The velocity fields obtained from both methods are in quantitative agreement. The granular flow exhibits two distinct regions: a surface flow layer and a static flow regime corresponding to rigid rotation near the drum bottom. The thickness of th…

Author(s): F. M. Rocha, H. Lhuissier, Y. Forterre, and B. Metzger<br /><p>Despite the burst in studies on shear-thickening (ST) suspensions over the past decade, a simple and yet fundamental question has remained unanswered: what is the the drag on a solid object moving in such medium? By addressing this problem, we reveal a novel stress-focusing phenomenology in discontinuous ST suspensions, which we term jamming rays. Key features of these anisotropic and intermittent structures, such as their…

arXiv:2602.08217v1 Announce Type: cross Abstract: Spatially varying flow laws have been identified in dry granular flow, yet their applicability to unjammed suspensions remains unclear. This study demonstrates that the quasistatic suspension flow combines dry granular rheology with nonlocal effects in the shear band and damped viscous flow in the outer creep region. Through rotary shear experiments on a hydrogel granular raft, we observe that the flow decays from the interface in the quasistatic…

arXiv:2602.08045v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: It is shown that the upper limit on the fraction of power that can be extracted from an airstream approaching a wind turbine is about 78% rather than the historical value of 59%. This higher limit is based on the assumption that the wind turbine cannot accelerate the flow at its exit plane above the freestream velocity. The derivation of the historical limit of 59% must either violate the angular momentum equation or the continuity equation.

arXiv:2602.08445v1 Announce Type: new Abstract: Dense suspensions of deformable particles can exhibit rich nonequilibrium dynamics arising from complex flow-structure coupling. Using a multi-phase field model, we show that steady shear drives an initially disordered, dense, soft suspension into a positionally and orientationally ordered state, within which particles undergo robust self-sustained shape oscillations. These oscillations originate from repeated T1 neighbor exchanges that force the o…
